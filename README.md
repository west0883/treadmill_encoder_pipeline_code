# treadmill_encoder_pipeline_code

This code extracts and segments the velocity of a flat disk treadmill. Position of the treadmill is recorded by a rotary encoder controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, with the output reported to the serial monitor. This code is designed for use with head-fixed mice by the Ebner Lab at the University of Minnesota. These techniques are used in a [peer-reviewed scientific article](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab373). 

The entire pipleine should be run from the pipeline_treadmillencoder.m script in the Control Scripts folder.

This code calls on code created by other programmers, including importlog.m . Credit belongs to the original creators of each part of this code, and should be cited accordingly.
